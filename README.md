# Code repository for the study "Individual energy dynamics mediate mammal community response to combined habitat fragmentation and drought stress" 
Authors: Leonna Szangolies, Cara A. Gallagher, Florian Jeltsch

We adapted and used the individual based metabolic community model presented in https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.14134 and available at https://zenodo.org/records/11394735 for this study. We here applied it to scenarios of combined habitat fragmentation and drought occurrence to study the effect on coexistence and community dynamics.
The adapted model is available in NetLogo (version 6.1.0): mibom.nlogo. For a detailed model description (ODD) and full documentation of the modelling (TRACE) see the publication and the supplementary material.
We used this model to simulate data which we analysed and visualised using a Python notebook (Python version 3.8): code_figures.ipynb.
